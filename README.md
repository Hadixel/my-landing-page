# Landing Page Project
This project is a demonstration of HTML and CSS skills, specifically focusing on Flexbox, as part of The Odin Project's Foundations course. The goal was to build a complete landing page from scratch based on a provided design specification.

## üìù Project Overview

For this assignment, I created my personal portfolio landing page under the developer name 'Hadixel.' While the layout and structure are based on the examples provided by The Odin Project, the content, images, and theme have been customized to reflect my personal journey into software development.
